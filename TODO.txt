- Primitive types should not be references.

INTEGRATION
- Import from JSON (create static typename property)
- Types of values (list of exports, list of exported values, list of exported types)
- Find a specific export
- Simple tests
- Validate recursive types with a WeakMap to store already validated items

FUTURE
- Pretty ids (double-id mapping)
- Generics
- Generics validation
- Heavy tests
- JSDoc
- Decorators?
- Namespace declarations
- Template literals advanced (with validation)
- Extending primitive types with additional properties
- Add parameters name to function signatures
