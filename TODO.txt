- Generics for functions / constructors (validation based on constraints + several types sharing a generic must be compatible)
- Documentation
- CI/CD

FUTURE
- Namespace declarations?
- Symbols
- Refining extended primitive types: if the extension define new fields, the type cannot be represented solely as a primitive type
