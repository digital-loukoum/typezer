- Type declarations should also be types (or composable types)
- Decorators
- Types of values (list of exports, list of exported values, list of exported types)
- Find a specific export
- Simple tests
- Heavy tests

FUTURE
- Messages when trying to use generics
- Template literals
- Extending primitive types with additional properties
