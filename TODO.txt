- Type declarations should also be types (or composable types). To test with recursive declaration types
- Detect generics
- Define generics with conditions at type or function declarations

INTEGRATION
- Types of values (list of exports, list of exported values, list of exported types)
- Find a specific export
- Simple tests
- Export to JSON
- Import from JSON (create static typename property)

VALIDATION
- Each type should have a validate method that takes a variable of type unknown as argument.
- Basic generic validation based on generic constraints (no inference).

FUTURE
- Heavy tests
- JSDoc
- Decorators?
- Namespaces
- Template literals advanced (with validation)
- Extending primitive types with additional properties
