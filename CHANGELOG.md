# Beta
### 0.9.8
- Fix files watching: also watch dependencies
- Fix type of schema in `Typezer.watch()` 
### 0.9.7
- Validators can accept a record of type as schema (instead of a record of declaration, which was not necessary)

### 0.9.6
- Strict priority and include root type when walking through base types to make sure that all class members are captured
